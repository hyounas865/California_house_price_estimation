# California_house_price_estimation
This project is an implementation of the housing prices prediction problem using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the original [1990 California census dataset], which contains information about various attributes of houses in California.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to predict the median house value based on various attributes such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity. The project is divided into the following sections:

## Data Preparation: 
This section involves importing the necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and performing initial data exploration.
## Data Preprocessing: 
This section involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
## Model Selection and Evaluation: 
This section involves selecting appropriate machine learning models, training them on the preprocessed data, and evaluating their performance using various metrics.
## Model Tuning and Optimization: 
This section involves fine-tuning the selected models to improve their performance and optimizing their hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search.
## Data Preparation
The dataset is loaded using pandas and explored using various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices. The dataset contains 20,640 instances and 10 attributes.

## Data Preprocessing
The data is preprocessed in the following steps:

## Data Cleaning: 
Missing values are handled by dropping the rows containing missing values.
## Data Encoding: 
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding techniques.
## Data Scaling: 
Numerical variables are scaled using standardization and normalization techniques.
## Model Selection and Evaluation
Two machine learning models are selected for this project: [Linear Regression] and [Decision Tree Regression]. The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Model Tuning and Optimization
The hyperparameters of the selected models are tuned using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search. The optimized models are then evaluated using the same metrics as before.

## Results
The optimized Decision Tree Regression model achieves an RMSE of 18,603.52 on the test set.

# Future Work
The following techniques can be explored to further improve the model performance:

## Ensemble Methods: 
Techniques such as [Random Forest] and [Gradient Boosting] can be used to improve the model performance.
## Deep Learning Models: 
Deep learning models such as [Neural Networks] and [Convolutional Neural Networks] can be used to improve the model performance.
Feature Engineering: New features can be created by combining existing features or using domain knowledge.
